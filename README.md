# Elevate-Labs-CYBER-SECURITY--Personal-Firewall-Python
A Python-based personal firewall that captures and filters network traffic using Scapy. Supports custom block/allow rules for IPs, ports, and protocols, and logs suspicious packets for auditing.

# ðŸ”¥ Personal Firewall using Python

A simple yet effective **personal firewall** built using **Python** and **Scapy**.  
This firewall monitors and filters network traffic based on custom **rules** (IP, Port, and Protocol) and logs suspicious packets for auditing.  
Created as part of a cybersecurity internship project, it demonstrates the core concepts of **packet sniffing, filtering, and logging**.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Real-Time Packet Sniffing**: Captures and inspects all incoming/outgoing packets.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows blocking or allowing traffic based on:
  - IP addresses
  - Port numbers
  - Protocols (TCP/UDP)
